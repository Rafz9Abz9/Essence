# UX & Website Design

## Strategy

### User Stories

1.	As a first-time user, I want to:
- Understand the main purpose of the website immediately.
- Easily navigate through the pages.
- Effortlessly search for products available.
- Purchase for products without creating an account.
- View the reviews submitted by other users.
- Access the pages on any devices or screen sizes. 
- Have the option to login or create a user account.
- Contact the company regarding any questions I may have.

2.	As a registered user, I want to:
- Access my account information/profile page.
- View my order history.
- View my product reviews.
- View my wish list.
- Have the option to opt-in and opt-out of newsletter subscription. 
- Update and save my personal information.
- Make purchases with my delivery information pre-filled. 
- Leave reviews for products.

3.	As an admin, I want to:
- Easily create, read, update, and delete products.
- Manage customer reviews efficiently.
- Delete any inappropriate customer reviews.
- Ensure efficient access and security measures for admin controls and functions.

## Structure
The website is set up with different pages, and each page is made for a specific type of user. The flow diagram below shows how these pages are organized and gives details about what you can find on each of them. This was created using [Lucidchart](https://lucid.co/)

## Skeleton

1. Database Schema
- I created a clear and organized layout for the database in order to make building the website easier for me.
- I used [DrawSQL](https://drawsql.app/) to draw the database which uses a database called Postgres.

### Home Page

- This page consists of a slideshow that introduces the categories that are present on the website. There are also two images on the right side of the slideshow.
- 'Shop Now' and 'Discover Now' buttons are included on the images. These buttons if clicked will take the users to their respective pages. For example, if the 'Shop Now' button which is on the 'Hair Care' image is clicked by the user, it will take them to the Hair Care products page.
- The 'Gift Sets' image has a 'Discover Now' button. It has not been implemented yet, this is just for visual purposes. For future implementation, the gift sets are products that will be 'Available From 5th March 2024' (visible on the page), if the user selects the button, it will take them to the products page for 'Gifts Sets'. But for now, this feature has not been implemented.
