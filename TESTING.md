## CSS

All the CSS files were tested through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input). Majority of them are minified so couldn't do the testing on them. I was able to test checkout.css and base.css and the results are below.

## JavaScript

- JavaScript was sourced from the Bootstrap template.

## Python

- All the Python files were tested through the [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/).
- The Python files were examined during testing, revealing primarily formatting-related issues such as whitespace inconsistencies, missing whitespace, trailing whitespace, and lines exceeding the recommended length.
- These errors pertain to coding style and formatting rather than functional defects within the codebase.
- To address these issues efficiently, I utilized a tool named **autopep8** to automatically correct the identified formatting discrepancies.
