# Essence - Testing

During the project's development, I conducted multiple tests to guarantee the site's functionality. This section contains comprehensive documentation detailing all tests performed across the entire website.

# Code Validation

## HTML

All the HTML files were tested through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). 


## CSS

All the CSS files were tested through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input). 

| FILE      | SCREENSHOT | NOTES            |
|-----------|------------|------------------|
| style.css | [Screenshot](link_to_screenshot) |  |
| base.css  | ![image](https://github.com/Rafz9Abz9/Essence/assets/126483536/0726b086-2370-4e3d-93b6-05f00db281c2)|  PASS â€“ NO ERRORS |


## JavaScript

- JavaScript was sourced from the Bootstrap template.

## Python

- All the Python files were tested through the [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/).
- The Python files were examined during testing, revealing primarily formatting-related issues such as whitespace inconsistencies, missing whitespace, trailing whitespace, and lines exceeding the recommended length.
- These errors pertain to coding style and formatting rather than functional defects within the codebase.
- To address these issues efficiently, I utilized a tool named **autopep8** to automatically correct the identified formatting discrepancies.

# User Story Testing

These are some of the user stories that I have implemented.
